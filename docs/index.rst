----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`xyzpy <https://github.com/jcmgray/xyzpy>`__ is python library for efficiently generating, manipulating and plotting data with a lot of dimensions, of the type that often occurs in numerical simulations. It stands wholly atop the labelled N-dimensional array library `xarray <http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/>`__. The project is hosted on `github <https://github.com/jcmgray/xyzpy>`__, please do submit any issues or PRs there.

The aim is to take the pain and errors out of generating and exploring data with a high number of possible parameters. This means:

- you don't have to write super nested for loops
- you don't have to remember which arrays/dimensions belong to which variables/parameters
- you don't have to parallelize over or distribute runs yourself
- you don't have to worry about loading, saving and merging disjoint data
- you don't need to guess when a set of runs is going to finish

As well as the ability to automatically parallelize over runs, ``xyzpy`` provides the :class:`~xyzpy.Crop` object that allows runs and results to be written to disk, these can then be run by any process with access to the files - e.g. a batch system - or just serve as a convenient persistent progress mechanism.

In terms of post-processing, as well as all the power of `xarray <http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/>`__, ``xyzpy`` adds uneven step differentiation and error propagation, filtering and interpolation - along any axis just specified by name.

The aim of the plotting functionality is to keep the same interface between interactively plotting the data using `bokeh <https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/>`__, and static, publication ready figures using `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`__, whilst being able to see the dependence on up to 4 dimensions at once.

Quick-start
-----------

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [1]: import xyzpy as xyz
       ...: import time as time

    In [2]: @xyz.label(var_names=['sum', 'diff'])
       ...: def sumdiff(a, b):
       ...:     time.sleep(0.5)
       ...:     return a + b, a - b
       ...:

    In [3]: combos = {'a': range(1, 10), 'b': range(23, 27)}

    In [4]: sumdiff.run_combos(combos, parallel=True)

Installation
------------

``xzypy`` is itself a pure python package and can be found on `pypi <https://pypi.org/project/xyzpy/>`_. The core dependencies are:

- `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`__
- `xarray <http://xarray.pydata.org/en/latest/>`__ - *labelled ndarrays*
- `joblib <https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`__ - *serialization and parallel processing*
- `tqdm <https://tqdm.github.io>`__ - *progress bars*

Processing functions like filtering and differentiating require:

- `scipy <https://www.scipy.org/>`__
- `numba <http://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/index.html>`__ - *compiled gufuncs*

and the plotting functionality is provided by:

- `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`__
- `bokeh <https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/>`__ - *interactive plotting*

The recommended way of installing these is using the `conda <https://conda.io/miniconda.html>`__ package manager. A development version of ``xyzpy`` can be installed directly from github using the command:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -U git+https://github.com/jcmgray/xyzpy.git
